This happened a few weeks ago now, but it's permanently burned into my brain, 
So I have an inbuilt defibrillator, that will monitor my heartbeat and shock me if my heartrate raises above 180 BPM,
and it plays an important role in my tale.
so,
it's 3am and I feel like shit, really bad pain in my lower abdomen,
at this point everyone else in my family has gone to bed, so after about 3 hours of suffering, I say fuck it.
and decide to go have a shower. and it relieves the pain, though, because I was alone, in the shower, with no-one else awake, I say fuck it, may's well jerk off. and I'm going along and.
BOOM
I black out. 
I come to, Scream for my mother (at first I thought I was having a stroke, oh the irony).
Turns out the combo of jackin' it and hot water bought my heart rate up to 217!
BOOM
I black out a 2nd time. my mother rushes into the bathroom and sees me with a raging boner.
BOOM BAM BAM
I black out once more. and collapse in the shower.
my mother wakes me up, and calms me down (turns out being electrocuted tends to increase your heartrate) , as I get continually shocked. and I end up in the ER a 4AM in the morning, having to explain, to my own mother, and 3 female nurses, why my heartrate was so high at 3AM in the shower.
I will never live this down.
